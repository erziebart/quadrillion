# quadrillion-solver
Quadrillion is a logic puzzle invented by Smart Games. The objective is to fit 12 pieces of varying sizes and shapes onto a board. The four board pieces can be flipped, rotated, and arranged into different shapes, which varies the difficulty of the puzzle. This program allows a user to choose a board arrangement and uses a recursive algorithm to find solutions for that particular board.
